# React Sales Website

This is a sales website built with **React** using the [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/). The application includes functionality for filtering products by category, adding/removing items from the cart, and a login system. The project uses **custom hooks** and **Context API** to manage state and provide a smooth user experience.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Displays products fetched from the FakeStore API.
- **Category Filter**: Allows users to filter products by category.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to the cart.
- **Remove from Cart**: Users can remove products from the cart.
- **Total Price Calculation**: Automatically calculates the total price of items in the cart.
- **Login System**: Users can log in to the application (placeholder for authentication logic).
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for different screen sizes.
- **Custom Hooks & Context API**: Efficient state management and custom logic abstraction.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Context API**: For global state management (e.g., cart, user login).
- **Custom Hooks**: For reusing logic across components (e.g., data fetching, cart management).
- **React Router**: For routing between different pages (Home, Checkout, Login).
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application.
